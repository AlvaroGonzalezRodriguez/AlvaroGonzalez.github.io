- I am a software engineer and a writer interested in the interplay between thoughts and constraints, the duality of interpretations and representations, and the nature of abstractions and correspondence between them. 

- I am a long time practioner of Vipassana, but I am also a fallibilist with a slight objectivist bent. So I probably have a very different view of meditation than most people. We can talk about it if you want to.

- On this website I write articles about [[Computer Science::/tags/#Software]], [[Philosophy::/tags/#Philosophy]], Mathematics, and [[Generic Life Stuff::/tags/#General]]. Sometimes I also [[review::/tags/#Review]] books that I've read. You can find my programming side-projects on [[github::https://www.github.com/raghuveerdotnet]]

- I have a [[youtube channel::https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESc8TaWpQxpHEnfhQLgzPQ]] on which I stream my work log(live writing sessions, coding sessions, reading/researching sessions, etc).
