Welcome to the Jekyll garden theme. This is how notes are shown. 

## Formating 
* Please remember that the name of the file and the title given inside the front matter must be the same. 
* Add `notetype:feed` in notes frontmatter to list them on the homepage feed. (I use notetype:unfeed for rest). 
* `date` in YAML is used to sort the feed, the latest comes in the first format. (DD-MM-YYYY)

## Hidden Notes Example
For example, you won't be seeing [[Hidden from the feed]] on your feed, but it's in your working notes, linkable, and has a URL. (Hover on the link to see the preview, click to read it!)

## Markdown support
Check [[All Markdown Rendered]] to see how the markdown element works.
