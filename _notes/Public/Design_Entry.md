# The importance of level design
<p>Basically the game level design defines how a game can be played, if it is fun for the player and also if it is enjoyable or challenging. A poorly designed level can make a game feel frustrating and tedious, so it is important to put a lot of the development time into finding the player's experience that you, as a developer, want to make.</p>
<p>But, there isn't a general rule that can be followed just to make a game's level design perfect. There are some factors, like the game's difficulty or the game's genre that heavily influences the level design</p>
