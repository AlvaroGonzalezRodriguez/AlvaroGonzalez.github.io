#### Instal Jekyll Theme

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is set up just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. `_notes` contain all atomic notes. If you want to use this for blog, add posts inside `_posts` folder, following standard Jekyll frontamtter. 

Directories `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_notes`, `_posts` and `assets` are synced with Git. `_site` and `_notes/Private` are ignored from Git syncing. Do check `.gitignore`.
